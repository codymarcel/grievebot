Description:

	Grievebot is a Salesforce.com's Chatter feed to speech unit. The rails application authenticates to a Salesforce.com organization over OAUTH2.
	Chatter posts are then served up to an Arduino device over the internet. The Arduino will then translate the text messages into audio output.  
Setup:

Prefix SALESFORCE or DBDOTCOM {SALESFORCE_OAUTH2_URI}
The following environment variables need to set. You will need to create a development org on Salesforce.com.
      APPLY_MSG_RULES {	true 	- will use db.com to apply specific rules to the message before being sent. (In DEV and not fully support yet.)
      					false 	- will send the message to Arduino as is.}
      _OAUTH2_URI,
      _OAUTH2_KEY,
      _OAUTH2_SECRET,
      _OAUTH2_URI,
      _OAUTH2_PASSWORD
